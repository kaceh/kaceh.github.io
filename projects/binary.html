                <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, many online seminars or webinars 
                    were held. Hundreds were created, published, and attended every week.

                <h2>What I've Learned</h2>
                <p>
                    My team and I conducted extensive testing on this project. In 
                    addition to A/B testing, we also performed usability testing and 
                    contextual inquiry. Through this experience, I learned that the 
                    <span class="bold">design process is iterative</span>, 
                    where every piece of feedback can 
                    lead to a new phase of design thinking. For example, when a 
                    participant mentioned the difficulty of managing webinar 
                    payments and registration, our team had to revisit the definition 
                    stage. We needed to redefine the problems within the webinar 
                    registration process and ultimately proposed providing webinar 
                    registration with e-wallet-based payments and simplified 
                    registrant management for the webinar provider.
                    <br><br>
                    We had to  iterate and refine our approach repeatedly, primarily 
                    to ensure that the process through BINARY wouldn't be more 
                    complex than existing webinar registration flows. Our research 
                    indicated that most people register for webinars through simple 
                    Google Forms. However, because we were also addressing the 
                    challenge of advertising the webinar itself, we focused on 
                    seamlessly categorizing and filtering webinars based on our 
                    prospective users' needs. Therefore, I also learned that 
                    <span class="bold">accurately defining the problem is crucial</span> 
                    before proposing a solution.
